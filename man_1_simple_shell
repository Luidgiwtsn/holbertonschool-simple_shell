.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input in interactive mode.
.PP
.B simple_shell
is a simple implementation of a Unix shell. It provides a basic command-line interface that allows users to execute programs and navigate the file system. The shell displays a "$ " prompt in interactive mode.
.SH OPTIONS
.B simple_shell
does not support any command-line options.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following commands are built into the shell:
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell.
.TP
.B cd [directory]
Change the current working directory to
.I directory.
If no directory is specified, change to the value of the
.B HOME
environment variable.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
Commands are executed by searching for the command name in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable. If the command name contains a slash, it is executed directly as a pathname.
.PP
Each command is executed in a separate child process using
.BR fork (2)
and
.BR execve (2).
The shell waits for the command to complete before prompting for the next command.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the following environment variables:
.TP
.B HOME
The default directory for the
.B cd
command.
.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for commands.
